# ASP jitter\_solve example script

## Requirements

Script *jitter_solve_G02G22.sh* is based on current stable version 3.2.0 of the [NASA Ames Stereo Pipeline](https://github.com/NeoGeographyToolkit/StereoPipeline) (ASP).

Both ASP and the [USGS Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers](https://zenodo.org/record/7106128) (ISIS, script based on current stable version 7.1.0) must be installed alongside with the IsisData files and the kernels for Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.

For the creation of the CSM camera models, the [Abstraction Layer for Ephemerides](https://github.com/DOI-USGS/ale) (ALE) is necessary.

We recommend installing all three components in the same Conda environment, installation order as mentioned here in the Readme.
